# Neural Network Charity Analysis (Neural Network / Deep Learning)

## Overview
Beks has come a long way since her first day at that boot camp five years ago—and since earlier this week, when she started learning about neural networks! Now, she is finally ready to put her skills to work to help the foundation predict where to make investments.

With your knowledge of machine learning and neural networks, you’ll use the features in the provided dataset to help Beks create a binary classifier that is capable of predicting whether applicants will be successful if funded by Alphabet Soup.

From Alphabet Soup’s business team, Beks received a CSV containing more than 34,000 organizations that have received funding from Alphabet Soup over the years. 

Deliverable 1: Preprocessing Data for a Neural Network Model
Using your knowledge of Pandas and the Scikit-Learn’s StandardScaler(), you’ll need to preprocess the dataset in order to compile, train, and evaluate the neural network model later in Deliverable 2.

Deliverable 2: Compile, Train, and Evaluate the Model:
Using your knowledge of TensorFlow, you’ll design a neural network, or deep learning model, to create a binary classification model that can predict if an Alphabet Soup–funded organization will be successful based on the features in the dataset. You’ll need to think about how many inputs there are before determining the number of neurons and layers in your model. Once you’ve completed that step, you’ll compile, train, and evaluate your binary classification model to calculate the model’s loss and accuracy.

Deliverable 3: Optimize the Model:
Using your knowledge of TensorFlow, optimize your model in order to achieve a target predictive accuracy higher than 75%. If you can't achieve an accuracy higher than 75%, you'll need to make at least three attempts to do so.

## Results

Using bulleted lists and images to support your answers, address the following questions.

- Data Preprocessing

    - What variable(s) are considered the target(s) for your model?

    - What variable(s) are considered to be the features for your model?

    - What variable(s) are neither targets nor features, and should be removed from the input data?

- Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model

    - How many neurons, layers, and activation functions did you select for your neural network model, and why?

    - Were you able to achieve the target model performance?

    - What steps did you take to try and increase model performance?
